# Sales-Performance-Dashboard-Real-time-analysis-of-key-business-metrics-using-VBA

This project aims to develop a VBA-powered solution that integrates inventory optimization along with sales and profit monitoring. This tool will focus on creating a user-friendly interface to easily extract the data where clients can input various prompts to generate comprehensive data projections including sales, customer and product details 
that client wants to understand regarding the companyâ€™s inventory. Simultaneously it will allow the client to automate the profit, revenue, returns and inventory calculations. The solution will incorporate sensitivity analysis with dynamic charts, enabling clients to simulate different logistic comparisons and get proper insights on how good/bad their products are doing in the market.
